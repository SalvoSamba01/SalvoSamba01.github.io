I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, focusing on Generative AI, Video Understanding, and Multimedia Forensics. My research explores how to analyze and interpret complex visual content from videos, as well as the capabilities, limitations, and societal impact of modern generative models and synthetic media. I design methods for video understanding that combine deep learning, representation learning, and multimodal reasoning to extract meaningful information from dynamic visual data.

Alongside my academic work, I am an AI Engineer and Researcher at iCTLab s.r.l., where I develop and deploy AI solutions across a range of domains. I primarily work on computer vision projects, but I also contribute to systems involving time series analysis, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this role, I bridge research and production: I design models, build scalable pipelines, and translate cutting-edge ideas into real-world applications. I am also actively involved in research activities within the company, contributing to experimental prototypes, publications, and collaborative innovation.
