        summary: "A comprehensive benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes created by text-to-video models. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five state-of-the-art open-source T2V generators, with human-in-the-loop validation and multiple compression versions. Experiments demonstrate limitations of current detectors with mean performance drops of 29.19% AUC, while proposing methods to achieve 93.81% AUC for unseen generators."
